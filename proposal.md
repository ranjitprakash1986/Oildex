# Oildex - The Oil Economy


## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose


**Role:** Analyst for Energy Research Consultancy

**Target Audience:** SLB Executives and Investors interested in the Oil Industry


The Oil industry is vital to our modern economy and it has been the central domain providing technological advancements, exploration and extraction of Oil resources to meet the every increasing energy demands. Despite the importance of the industry, it faces tumultous periods due to the volatility in energy demands. Unpredictable factors  such as political unrests in one part of the world can cause a heavy business impact on the Oil industry in another part. Thus concerned executives and investors keep themselves abreast of the metrics and price movements periodically to make informed business and investment decisions. My dashboard aims to bring some pertinent trends together in one place to enable users to draw immediate insights.



## Section 2: Description of the Data


The data is compiled from 3 different sources. The compiled data contains essential monthly aggregated information on the Oil price, specifically WTI Crude Oil. This is a benchmark used by the oil market. When there are other benchmarks available as well such as Brent Oil, there is a strong positive correlation between their prices. For this reason only the WTI Oil price will be used for the objectives of this Dashboard. The data includes the Standard and Poor's 500 index, wjich tracks the performance of  500 large companies listed on the stock exchanges in the United States. This index closely represents the overall sentiments of the stock market due to global events and it often used as a benchmark the economic health for the United States and the rest of the world that is correlated with the US economy.
To provide perspective to the Stock's from the Oil industry specifically, the monthly stock price of Schlumberger are included. Finally, an essential gauge of the health of the Oil economy is the current drilling activity. This is oftern measured by the number of active Rigs (Rig Count). A larger rig count indicates there is expected increase in Oil demand and vice versa. The monthly average of the rig count across the world is used for the purposes of this Dashboard.

## Section 3: Research Questions


Adam is an investor with a diverse portfolio of stocks. Despite the diversity in his portfolio, he still owns a significant number of shares in companies in the Oil industry. He is concerned with the rapid transition of the energy industry towards renewable resources. He want to be able to understand the movement of Oil prices, the general stock market index and the Drilling activity across the world in a snapshot. In the past he has discovered this data through different sources and felt the process was time consuming and non intuitive. He believes if he can get a quick understanding of the following three relationships at a moments notice, he can make quick decisions to sell or buy more Oil stocks to make short term profits and mitigate long term losses.
